# 11 Blackjack Capstone Project

## Overview

A Python-based terminal game that simulates the classic card game, Blackjack (also known as 21). This project was created as part of Day 11 of Dr. Angela Yu's **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**. It has been enhanced with a browser-based JavaScript version to make the game more accessible for users who want to play directly online.

## Game Rules

The objective of Blackjack is to have a hand that totals as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. This version includes:
- **Face cards** (Jack, Queen, King) valued at 10.
- **Number cards** worth their face value.
- **Aces** that count as either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the hand most.

**Win, Lose, or Draw**:
- If your hand goes over 21, you lose instantly.
- If either player hits exactly 21 with their initial two cards, it‚Äôs a **Blackjack**.
- The dealer draws until reaching a minimum of 17.

## Features

- **Python Version**:
  - Terminal-based play.
  - Card drawing logic.
  - Score comparison and winner declaration.
  - Option to replay.
  
- **Browser Version**:
  - Interactive UI via HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
  - Event-driven logic replicating original game rules.
  - Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
